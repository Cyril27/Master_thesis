# Abstract
The basal ganglia and its main entry nucleus the striatum play a critical role in the control and
the modulation of spontaneous and voluntary actions. In parallel, research has established the
impact of the two efferent pathways of the striatum in motor learning. However, a more precise
study of the different neurons subpopulations of both pathways and their functionalities would
enable a more accurate understanding of encoding mechanisms used by the striatum during the
learning process. Using a combination of synchronous behavioral and neuronal activity record-
ings, a suitable framework for inter-neuron and even inter-animal analysis is built, allowing
comparison of neuron dynamics and their evolution across training sessions. We demonstrated
that direct and indirect pathways offer similar overall dynamics in terms of neuron engagement
and specification. A more precise analysis revealed the existence of specific and divergent sub-
populations in each pathway. By studying their dynamics and encoding patterns, we were able
to determine the role of each of these neuron clusters in motor learning. In addition, super-
vised learning algorithms allow us to extract that neuronal code is biased towards activation in
the direct pathway and likely biased towards inactivation in the indirect pathway. The results
highlight the presence of different direct and indirect pathway neurons subpopulations whose
combination enables motor learning and thus the optimal choice of behaviors to adopt for the
execution of the motor task.
